In a small saucepan enough to fit the amount of eggs you're cooking in one layer, boil ~1/2 inch of water. There should
be enough water for the egg to be half submerged when added to the pot. Once the water boils, carefully add the COLD
eggs to the pot. It's recommended to use a large spoon or something to keep the egg from dropping or cracking. Once the
eggs are added to the pot, cover the pot with a lid and let it boil/steam for 8 minutes. (~7-7.5 minutes for runny egg,
8 minutes for mostly cooked egg yolk, 9 minutes+ for hard boiled). Once the eggs are cooked, submerged eggs in cold
water or a similar method to keep the eggs from continuing to cook. After they are cool enough to handle, crack, peel,
and chop into pieces.
