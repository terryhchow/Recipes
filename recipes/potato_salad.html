    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces and boil from cold water until tender (15-20 mins).</ul> 
    <ul>Test with a fork to see when it easily breaks apart for doneness.</ul> 
    <ul>Drain potatoes but DO NOT rinse with cold water. (Note: this is actually supposed to be a warm potato salad, but it's good cold too). 
    It says to cool on a sheet pan, but I usually leave it in the pot.</ul>
    <ul>Trim rind and cook bacon. Personally, I like to use the oven. Place the cooked bacon on a paper towel to drain the
    grease.</ul>

    <ul>Add everything into a large bowl, mix together and enjoy.</ul>
