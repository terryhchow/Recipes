    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>Preheat oven to 350F and line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper liners</ul>
    <ul>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
        In a separate medium bowl, beat the butter and sugars together at a medium 
        high speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, vanilla, and milk, then mix 
        until no flour remains.  Do not overmix
    </ul>
    <ul>Fill each cupcake liner 1/2 way full with batter.  Bake cupcakes for 240-360
        minutes or until an inserted toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake
        comes out clean.  Let the cupcakes cool before frosting.
    </ul>
    <ul>For the caramel sauce, add sugar to a saugepan and whisk as it melts. 
        Stop whisking once it's melted and only swirl the pot occasionally (do not stir).
        Continue cooking until it reaches a deep amber color (approximately 350F).
        Once it reaches the dark amber color, add butter immediately and whisk 
        until dissolved.  WARNING: Caramel will bubble up when adding the butter.
        Remove from heat, and slowly add cream.  WARNING: Caramel will bubble up
        when adding cream.  Once the cream has been incorporated and a smooth sauce is formed,
        add fleur de sel and whisk to incorporate.  Let it cool 10-15 minutes prior to storing or using.
    </ul>
